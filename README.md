# Playing-with-Makehuman-scripts

WE are creating lookup tables for makehuman so that we can relate makehuman inputs with real metric measurements.
Using Makehuman-Master version for Python3 and PyQT5.
Download Makehuman for Python3 from the repository  https://github.com/RtjShreyD/makehuman
and once all dependencies are met and program is running on Linux environment only.......

1. Put fns.py in folder where Makehuman.py file is present, this is the same directory whicch consists of plugins directory.
3. When MH opens save the model that comes by default always by the name default.mhm, in the directory MH saves it by default.
2. Run the scripts from whithin Makehuman GUI scripting TAB and they will work. 

NOTE: We have not gone headless as it is not needed.
